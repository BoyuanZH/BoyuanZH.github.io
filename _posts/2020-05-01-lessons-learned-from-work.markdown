* Only do it when you understand why, even when the order is coming from higher management.
* When your work can affect other teams' work, prepare them well with the change you are going to introduce. Any delay or insufficient propagation of the message may result in inefficiency of the overall project and confusion among team members. A centralized information board can help a lot in this process.
