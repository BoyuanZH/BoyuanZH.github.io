This post is for recording the problems I encountered with using git and github, and how I resolved those issues.

### File too large to push in remote repo.

The "large file" issue happened when I was dealing with kaggle competition [NY Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration). With the project folder already built on my laptop, I only need to start a new repo on github and push the local folder on to that. However the pushing failed due to I have these **large data files**. 

Errors are shown:

```
remote: warning: File data/test.csv is 67.51 MB; this is larger than GitHub's recommended maximum file size of 50.00 MB
remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.
```

Since those data won't need further development, my solution is to **simply ignore** them in my remote repo.

Following steps applied:

```
git rm -r --cached .
git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch data/test.csv'
git filter-branch -f --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch data/train.csv'
git push origin master
```

If you want to reset the remote origin:

```
git remote set-url https://Taxi_Duration_Prediction.git
```

For future ignoring the change on those data files, `.gitignore` file was created in the repo, which records name of the folder name to be ignored: `data/`.
