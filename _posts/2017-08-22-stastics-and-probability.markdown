Through one month's study, today I have just finished the [Probability And Statistics](https://oli.cmu.edu/jcourse/workbook/activity/page?context=fbe0b6c00a0001dc688975d67e23e4ce) open course on CMU.

I begin to take this course for the purpose of strengthen a systemical understanding in probability and statistics, which is of course a strong foundamental component for machine learning.

This course is systematically organised with quite a lot insightful and practical examples which is helpful for me to capture the underlying concept. This course is composed of four parts, three of which are EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), Producing Data and Probability, all serving as the basic concepts needed to conqure the final unit of 'Probability Inference', i.e. how to infer the populational statistics or variable relationships by the evidence of sample data.

Very helpful and insightful course. Strong recommendation.
